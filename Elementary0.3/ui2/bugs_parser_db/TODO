Variance Issues -- High Variance Sampling?? [Normal Distribution depends on the variance]
NCHG has special way of handling UB/LB
Fix the groups issue. 
Make Note for high variance sampling
Make note for wishart and inverse
Test models and correctness
Fix Inverse function in LogicalNode. [Also Wishart Distribution]
Look into and Write Comments on ComputeFactorGraphTable [Created indices and joins]
Make all tables UNLOGGED
==========================================================================
TODO:
2. ISUNARYMINUS Required?? [Handle Unary Minus]
5. Optimizations have been removed
7. LogicalNode with multiple variables LHS -> Inverse?? Then is variablestoadd correct??
8. Bounds for node with node indexes and LogicalNode
9. Greenplum for materializing NNM
==========================================================================
Todo before release:
delete ui code.
Copy the licence information
5. Make a list of TODOs
3. Test on all the 95% BUGS models. Try all distributions
2. Try to optimize the queries as much as possible
9. New kind of Wishart Distribution
==========================================================================
PostgreSQL Tuning for bugs parser:
Tune PostgreSQL for performance:
Increase checkpoint segments
Increase buffer size
Increase work mem size
Increase maintanence work mem size
Turn fsync off
Checkpoint timeout
autovacuum off
wal_writer delay
==========================================================================
Not Supported:
Limitation can be a node too
Data Transformations
Wishart and Inverse
Truncation - (what is this? Some integration or is it just censor??)
Cumulative Function Implement
Generalised F
Rectangular format for DATA === NOT SUPPORTED
Comments not supported
To Implement Scalar Functions: cut, density, deviance, gammap, integral, 
post.p.value, prior.p.value,replicate.post(s),replicate.prior(s), solution(F(s), s1, s2, s3) 
==========================================================================
To Test (for current release):
TEST BY USING ALL DISTRIBUTIONS with different values of UB and LB
